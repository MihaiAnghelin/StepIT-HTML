    <h3>Case Study: Micro-lending, loans real quick.</h3>

    <p>Ever since the advent of M-Pesa a plethora of mobile based applications have risen to build value on top
            of the platform. We have seen whole range of applications from payment integrators like Lipisha, Pesapal,
            Jambopay and E-Commerce applications like CrowdPesa, Jumia, and Rupu. These applications have faced
            numerous challenges some of which we will address in the chapter on e-commerce. However, one class
            of applications namely micro-lending solutions have experienced rapid growth and utilization and unsurprisingly these are applications that are tightly integrated with M-Pesa or leverage of data from M-Pesa
            transactions. </p>
